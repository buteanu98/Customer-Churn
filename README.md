# Customer-Churn


In this Power BI case study, I investigated a dataset from an example telecom company called Databel and analyzed their churn rates. Analyzing churn doesn’t just mean knowing what the churn rate is: it’s also about figuring out why customers are churning at the rate they are, and how to reduce churn. I answered these questions by creating measures and calculated columns, while simultaneously creating eye-catching report pages.
